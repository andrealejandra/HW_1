REFACTORING

The provided html code was mostly functional but lacking in a variety of semantic elements. 

I started by making sure all of the "header" elements were functional and navigated to its corresponding section of the page. Where possible, I converted the abundance of div elements to specified sections and applied id's and classes to each visual element. This allowed me to make a more cohesive and concise CSS file without an unnecessary amount of repetition. This will also allow for more specific changes to be applied to each element if there is ever a need to do so. The CSS file was easier to navigate and augment with consolidated attribute lists.

If I had more time, I would've made sure the section with the "content" class had a background that fit better within the confines of its container. I would've liked to have paid more attention to the font color and spacing of the section with class of "benefits" to have made it look more cohesive.
